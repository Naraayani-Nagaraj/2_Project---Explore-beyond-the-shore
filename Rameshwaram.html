        <DD style="color: whitesmoke;font-weight: bolder; "><strong  style="font-style: italic;font-family: consolas">Ramanathaswamy temple</strong> A perfect blend of mind-boggling architecture and spiritual significance, Rameshwaram Temple, also known as Ramanathaswamy Temple of Tamil Nadu is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also boasts of being one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples of India. Not just spiritually, Rameshwaram Temple is appealing architecturally also. With the longest corridor of the world and immaculate carvings on pillars, it is definitely a treat for your eyes.
            The lingam in the Rameshwaram Temple was installed by Lord Rama but, the construction was led by several rulers over the centuries. Inside the temple, there are two lingams- Ramalingam and Shivalingam. The latter is still worshipped first to preserve the words of Lord Rama. Besides daily Abhishkams and poojas performed with great zeal, there are absorbing festivals worth witnessing.

        <dd style="color: whitesmoke;font-weight: bolder;  "><strong  style="font-style: italic;font-family: consolas"> Agni theertham </strong> One of the 64 sacred baths in Rameshwaram, the Agnitheertham is one of the most important theertham and receives a large number of tourists each day. Located on the beach side of Sri Ramanathaswamy temple, Agnitheertham is the only theertham sited outside the temple complex.
            In the Sanskrit language, the word agni means fire; while the word theertham means holy water. Agnitheertham has been mentioned several times in the ancient texts and mythological legends as a pilgrimage of significant importance among the Hindus. The devotees visiting the theertham offer their prayers to the deity and atone their sins by taking a dip in the holy waters.

        <dd style="color: whitesmoke;font-weight: bolder;  "><strong  style="font-style: italic;font-family: consolas"> Dhanushkodi</strong> is a small, sparsely populated beach town on the coast of Tamil Nadu. In the 1964, Dhanushkodi was hit by one of the worst storms India has ever seen. Ever since then, Tamil Nadu has rebuilt this town to become one of the most unique and unusual beach towns of India.
            This small town redefines the term isolated. Cut off from the rest of the world, this town seems untouched by time. While the rest of India is vying to get ahead in the race for prosperity, this town seems frozen in history, reflecting it grandeur and beauty.

Indian Ocean covers it from all its sides.
                    There had been several instances of cyclone in the area but the temple stayed to be intact even in most critical times. It too has the history and story of Ramayan in its footings. Here, Vibhishana, Ravan's brother joined hands with Rama and hence Vibhishana too is worshiped at this place. The temple has several wonderful paintings all around the walls of it which flows with the flow of Ramayana and one can enjoy being in the temple with the guide who keeps narrating the story at every instance of time.
